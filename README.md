# Sorting & Computational Scripts

A collection of classic computer science algorithms implemented in JavaScript. Created for educational purposes to demonstrate understanding of data structures and algorithmic complexity.

## Contents

1.  **Bubble Sort** (`bubble_sort.js`)
    * Implementation of the standard O(n²) sorting algorithm.
2.  **Binary Search** (`binary_search.js`)
    * Efficient O(log n) search algorithm for sorted arrays.
3.  **Recursion** (`factorial.js`)
    * Simple script calculating factorials to demonstrate recursive logic.
